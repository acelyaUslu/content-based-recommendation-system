# content-based-recommendation-system
In this project, a content-based recommendation system was created. Movie descriptions were vectorized with the TF-IDF method, and similarity was calculated with cosine similarity. When users selected a movie, similar movies were suggested. A recommendation function (content_based_recommender) was developed for this process.
